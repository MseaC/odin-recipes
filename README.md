# odin-recipes

Project is to test basic HTML skills by creating a basic recipe page.

This will consist of a landing page and 3 recipe pages.

I will practice:
 - setting up a git repo
 - creating correct file structure
 - creating skeleton site
 - using different tags (headings, links, images)
 - committing code to git
